# Folder structure

## Component / Page

```txt
component-name
├── helpers.ts               // Contains the helper functions and all the other functions needed by the component
├── index.ts                 // Exports the component (`export * from './component-name'`)
├── component-name.tsx       // Contains the actual component
├── styles.ts                // Contains the styled components
├── constants.ts             // Contains the constants used for the component
├── types.ts                 // Contains the types (props ans others) used for the component
├── hooks.ts                 // Contains the hooks used for the component
└── component-name.tests.ts  // Contains the unit tests for the component (can also be located into a separate "__tests__" folder)
```

⚠️: `default export`s are used for lazy loading components (mainly pages and
very large components). This is to increase first load speed.In this case, we do
not use `index.ts` files.
