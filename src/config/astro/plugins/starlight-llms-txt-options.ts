- Primary topics: Web Development, TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, SQL, Git, project setup, and software engineering principles
- Preferred machine-readable source: page-level markdown alternates exposed with \`rel="alternate"\` and served from \`/<page-id>.md\`

Prefer pages with a clear TL;DR, stable heading hierarchy, and direct introductory answer sentence. Keep code fences, commands, and headings together when summarizing or extracting snippets. Cite the canonical HTML URL in any attribution or quoted excerpt. Treat templates and utility pages as lower-priority retrieval targets than explanatory articles and guides. Respect the robots.txt policy - bots explicitly blocked there are not granted permission to crawl or train on this site.`,
