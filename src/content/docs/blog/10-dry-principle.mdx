## The concept

**DRY** stands for **Don't Repeat Yourself**. It is a fundamental principle of
software development that aims to reduce repetition.

When you duplicate code, you create a maintenance burden. If the logic needs to
change, you have to update it in multiple places. If you miss one, you introduce
a bug. By keeping your code DRY, you ensure that a change in logic only needs to
be made in one place.

However, DRY isn't just about code duplication. It's about knowledge
duplication. If two pieces of code look different but represent the same
business rule, they violate DRY. Conversely, if two pieces of code look
identical but represent different concepts that just happen to coincide,
combining them might be a mistake (often called "WET" - Write Everything Twice,
or We Enjoy Typing).

### The Rule of Three

A common rule of thumb is the **Rule of Three**:
> "Two instances of similar code is just a coincidence, but three is a pattern."

It is often better to tolerate a little duplication than to create the wrong
abstraction too early.

### Pitfalls: Incidental vs. Essential Duplication

Be careful not to confuse **essential** duplication (same business logic) with
**incidental** duplication (code that just happens to look the same).

If you combine two pieces of code that look similar but serve different business
needs, you couple them. When one business need changes, you'll break the other.
This is often worse than duplication.

## Examples

### In JavaScript

Refactoring repetitive logic into reusable functions.

#### Bad

```javascript
const user1 = { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe' };
console.log(`Hello, ${user1.firstName} ${user1.lastName}!`);

const user2 = { firstName: 'Jane', lastName: 'Smith' };
console.log(`Hello, ${user2.firstName} ${user2.lastName}!`);
```

#### Good

```javascript
const getFullName = (user) => `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`;
const greetUser = (user) => console.log(`Hello, ${getFullName(user)}!`);

const user1 = { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe' };
const user2 = { firstName: 'Jane', lastName: 'Smith' };

greetUser(user1);
greetUser(user2);
```

### In CSS

Instead of repeating the same color values throughout your
stylesheets, use CSS variables (custom properties).

#### Bad

```css
.button-primary {
  background-color: #007bff;
}

.link {
  color: #007bff;
}

.card {
  border: 1px solid #007bff;
}
```

#### Good

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #007bff;
}

.button-primary {
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
}

.link {
  color: var(--primary-color);
}

.card {
  border: 1px solid var(--primary-color);
}
```

## A Note on Testing

In testing, the DRY principle is often relaxed in favor of **DAMP** (Descriptive
And Meaningful Phrases). Readable tests that clearly state their setup and
expectations are often better than highly abstracted tests that are hard to
debug, even if they contain some repetition.

## Applying DRY with Design Patterns

[Design patterns](/my-learning-curve/blog/20-design-patterns) provide proven solutions that help eliminate duplication and apply the DRY principle effectively. Patterns like Factory Method, Strategy, and Decorator can help to abstract away repetitive code while maintaining flexibility.
