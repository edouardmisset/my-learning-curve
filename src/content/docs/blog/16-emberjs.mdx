## Introduction

As a React developer, you're used to thinking in terms of functions, hooks, and a "view-library" approach where you pick your own tools for routing and state management. **Ember.js**, on the other hand, is a full-featured framework that follows the "Convention over Configuration" philosophy.

While React gives you a box of Lego bricks to build your castle, Ember gives you the castle blueprint and the pre-assembled walls, asking you to decorate the rooms.

## The Mental Model Shift

### 1. Library vs. Framework

React focuses primarily on the View layer. You likely use libraries like `react-router` for routing, `tanstack-query` for data fetching, and `redux` or `zustand` for global state.

Ember includes all of these out of the box:
- **Router**: First-class citizen, determines the state of your application. The `application.hbs` template acts as the root layout, and `{{outlet}}` works exactly like React Router's `<Outlet />` to render nested routes.
- **Ember Data**: A robust data layer (similar to an ORM on the client).
- **Services**: Singletons for global state (Dependency Injection).
- **CLI**: A powerful command-line interface for generating code.

### 2. Functional vs. Object-Oriented

Modern React is heavily functional (Hooks, Functional Components). Ember has embraced modern JavaScript classes and **[Decorators](/my-learning-curve/blog/15-oop#decorators)**. Decorators (like `@tracked`, `@action`, `@service`) are just functions that wrap classes or properties to add behavior—similar to how Higher-Order Components worked in older React, but cleaner.

> See the article on [Object-Oriented Programming](/my-learning-curve/blog/15-oop) for a refresher on classes and inheritance, which are fundamental to Ember's architecture.

### 3. Reactivity: Virtual DOM vs. Tracked Properties

React uses the Virtual DOM and re-renders components when state changes (`useState`). You often need to worry about dependency arrays in `useEffect` or `useMemo`.

Ember uses **Tracked Properties** (Glimmer VM). You annotate a class property with `@tracked`, and when it changes, only the parts of the DOM that depend on it update. It's more akin to "fine-grained reactivity" (like Signals) than VDOM diffing.

> See [Memoization](/my-learning-curve/blog/04-memoization) for how React handles derived state.
> In Ember, you simply use a standard JavaScript `get` accessor, and it
> auto-tracks dependencies!

**Auto-tracking Simplified:**
Think of it like a spreadsheet formula. If you have a cell that calculates `A1 + B1`, it automatically updates whenever `A1` or `B1` changes. You don't have to tell Excel "watch A1 and B1".

Ember works the same way. If you have a getter that uses a `@tracked` property, Ember notices. When that property changes, Ember automatically updates anything using that getter. No dependency arrays required!

### 4. Syntax: JavaScript vs. Templates

React relies on **JSX**, which is effectively "Just JavaScript". You use standard JS methods like `.map()` for loops and ternary operators for conditionals.

Ember uses **Handlebars**, a dedicated templating language. It provides specific keywords for control flow (`{{#each}}`, `{{#if}}`).

*   **HBS (Handlebars)**: The classic approach. Templates are in separate files from logic. It enforces a strict separation of concerns but requires context switching between files.
*   **GTS/GJS (Glimmer)**: The modern evolution. It brings "Strict Mode" templates, meaning you must import everything you use (components, helpers). It allows for **Single File Components**, giving you lexical scope (using JS variables directly in templates) and better TypeScript support.

**Why do both exist?**
Ember is a mature framework. `.hbs` is the established standard that powers most existing apps. `.gts` is the future (part of the "Polaris" edition), designed to provide a developer experience closer to React/Vue while keeping Ember's powerful conventions.

## Key Differences & Examples

### Components

**React (JSX + Hooks):**

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count is {count}
    </button>
  );
}
```

**Ember:**

Ember traditionally separates logic (`.ts`) from templates (`.hbs`), but **GTS** (`.gts`) allows for Single File Components.

*Classic approach (Separate files):*

*component.ts*
```ts
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';
import { action } from '@ember/object';

export default class Counter extends Component {
  @tracked count = 0;

  @action
  increment() {
    this.count++;
  }
}
```

*template.hbs*
```hbs
<button type="button" {{on "click" this.increment}}>
  Count is {{this.count}}
</button>
```

*Modern approach (.gts):*

```ts
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';
import { on } from '@ember/modifier';

export default class Counter extends Component {
  @tracked count = 0;

  increment = () => this.count++;

  <template>
    <button type="button" {{on "click" this.increment}}>
      Count is {{this.count}}
    </button>
  </template>
}
```

### Component Patterns

| Concept | React | Ember |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Children** | `props.children` | `{{yield}}` |
| **Props (Data)** | `props.name` | `{{@name}}` (Arguments) |
| **Props (HTML Attr)** | `className="foo"` | `class="foo"` (passed via `...attributes`) |
| **Attribute Spreading** | `<div {...props} />` | `<div ...attributes>` (HTML attributes only) |
| **Namespacing** | `import RentalImage ...` | `<Rental::Image />` (File: `rental/image.hbs`) |

> **Note on Namespacing**: If you create a component at `app/components/rental/image.hbs`, you invoke it as `<Rental::Image>`. This helps organize components by feature folders.

> **Typing Arguments**: In TypeScript, you can type component arguments by defining an interface and passing it to the Component generic:
> ```ts
> interface CounterArgs {
>   start: number;
> }
> export default class Counter extends Component<CounterArgs> { ... }
> ```

### Conditionals and Loops

**React:**
```tsx
{isLoggedIn ? <UserMenu /> : <LoginButton />}

<ul>
  {items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)}
</ul>
```

**Ember:**
```hbs
{{#if this.isLoggedIn}}
  <UserMenu />
{{else}}
  <LoginButton />
{{/if}}

<ul>
  {{#each this.items as |item|}}
    <li>{{item.name}}</li>
  {{/each}}
</ul>
```

### State Management (Services vs Context)

In React, you might use `Context` to share state. In Ember, you use **Services**.

```ts
// app/services/shopping-cart.ts
import Service from '@ember/service';
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';

export default class ShoppingCartService extends Service {
  @tracked items = [];

  add(item) {
    this.items = [...this.items, item];
  }
}
```

Injecting it into a component:

```ts
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { service } from '@ember/service';

export default class Product extends Component {
  @service declare shoppingCart: ShoppingCartService;
  
  // Usage: this.shoppingCart.add(item)
}
```

### Data Loading & Routing

In React, you fetch data inside components (using `useEffect` or libraries like TanStack Query). In Ember, **Routes** are responsible for fetching data.

**React:**
```tsx
// Post.tsx
const { data } = useQuery({ queryKey: ['post', id], queryFn: fetchPost });
```

**Ember:**
```ts
// app/routes/post.ts
import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
import { service } from '@ember/service';

export default class PostRoute extends Route {
  @service declare store: Store;

  model(params) {
    // The model hook waits for the promise to resolve before rendering.
    // It is responsible for fetching and preparing any data needed for the route.
    return this.store.findRecord('post', params.post_id);
  }
}
```
The data returned from `model()` is available in the template as `{{@model}}`.

**Navigation:**
Instead of `<Link to="...">`, Ember uses the `<LinkTo>` component.

```hbs
<LinkTo @route="post" @model={{this.post.id}}>
  Read more
</LinkTo>
```

### Testing

Ember has testing built-in. When you generate a component (`ember g component my-comp`), it automatically creates a test file.

*   **QUnit**: The default test runner (similar to Jest/Mocha).
*   **Test Helpers**: `@ember/test-helpers` provides utilities like `click`, `fillIn`, `render`.
> **Note**: Running tests feels slower than React because Ember tests typically run in a real browser environment (building and rendering the app), providing high-fidelity results but at the cost of speed.
```ts
import { module, test } from 'qunit';
import { setupRenderingTest } from 'my-app/tests/helpers';
import { render, click } from '@ember/test-helpers';
import { hbs } from 'ember-cli-htmlbars';

module('Integration | Component | counter', function (hooks) {
  setupRenderingTest(hooks);

  test('it increments', async function (assert) {
    await render(hbs`<Counter />`);
    
    assert.dom('button').hasText('Count is 0');
    await click('button');
    assert.dom('button').hasText('Count is 1');
  });
});
```

## Gotchas for React Devs

1.  **Mutating State**: In React, you *never* mutate state directly (`count++` is forbidden). In Ember with `@tracked`, **mutation is the standard way** to trigger updates (`this.count++` works perfectly).
2.  **"Actions"**: In React, you pass functions as props. In Ember, you use the `{{on "event" this.method}}` modifier. You often need the `@action` decorator to bind `this` correctly.
3.  **Two-Way Binding**: React is strictly one-way data flow. Ember allows two-way binding (especially in forms) using the `{{mut}}` helper or modern patterns, though "Data Down, Actions Up" is still the preferred architecture.
4.  **The Run Loop**: Ember has an internal "Run Loop" to batch DOM updates. You rarely need to touch it in modern Ember, but you might see errors related to it in older codebases or async tests.
