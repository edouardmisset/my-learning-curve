For years, developers have asked the same question: *"Can I use this feature yet?"*

The answer usually involved checking [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/), deciphering release notes from Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, and consulting your analytics to see which browsers your users are actually on. It was a fragmented process.

Enter **Baseline**.

## What is Baseline?

[Baseline](https://web.dev/baseline) is an initiative by the Web DX Community Group (which includes Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla) to clarify the status of web features. It aims to provide a common language and definition for "safe to use."

Baseline categorizes features into three main stages:

### 1. Limited Availability

Everything starts here. Features that are experimental, behind flags, or only implemented in some browsers but not the other major browsers.

### 2. Baseline Newly Available

A feature becomes "**Newly Available**" when it is interoperable across the core browser engines:
- **Chrome** (Google)
- **Edge** (Microsoft)
- **Firefox** (Mozilla)
- **Safari** (Apple)

Once a feature lands in the stable release of *all* these browsers, it is now **Baseline Newly Available**.

### 3. Baseline Widely Available

A feature becomes "**Widely Available**" **30 months** after it becomes **Newly Available**. 

This 30-month window is chosen because it generally covers the update cycle for most users and enterprise environments. If a feature is Widely Available, you can generally use it without worrying about polyfills or fallbacks for the vast majority of users.


## Tooling and Ecosystem

The Baseline status is being integrated into the tools we use every day:
- **[Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/):** Now displays the Baseline badge and status (New/Widely) on feature pages.
- **[MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/):** Shows the Baseline status at the top of feature pages.
- **[Browserslist](https://browserslist.dev/):** You can now query based on Baseline status.
  ```sh
  # Targets browsers that support widely available features
  pnpx browserslist "baseline newly available" 
  ```
- **[Baseline Dashboard](https://edouardmisset.github.io/baseline/)**: it
  provides a live dashboard of your selection of Baseline features and their
  statuses.

## For Fullstack TS Developers

Integrating `browserslist` with TypeScript requires some manual synchronization, as TypeScript does not automatically read your `browserslist` configuration.

1.  **Browserslist**: Handles polyfills (via Babel/PostCSS) and CSS prefixes.
    ```json
    // package.json
    "browserslist": [
      "baseline widely available",
      "not IE 11"
    ]
    ```

2.  **TypeScript (`tsconfig.json`)**: Handles syntax down-leveling.
    If you use a bundler (Vite, Webpack), it will handle the heavy lifting based on `browserslist`. You can keep your TS target modern.
    ```json
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "ES2022",
        "lib": ["DOM", "DOM.Iterable", "ES2022"]
      }
    }
    ```

3.  **Bundler Integration (e.g., Vite)**:
    Vite handles CSS (via PostCSS) based on your `browserslist` automatically. For JavaScript transpilation (via esbuild), you often need to convert your `browserslist` config to a format `esbuild` understands.

    One popular way is using the `browserslist-to-esbuild` package:

    ```ts
    // vite.config.ts
    import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
    import browserslistToEsbuild from 'browserslist-to-esbuild';

    export default defineConfig({
      build: {
        // Automatically syncs your JS build target with your browserslist config
        target: browserslistToEsbuild(), 
      },
    });
    ```

## Using the Baseline Component

You can embed the official Baseline status widget on your own documentation or dashboards. There is a web component available that fetches the data live.

### In Vanilla HTML

You can treat it like any other HTML element after importing the script.

1. **Import the script**:

```html
<script 
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/baseline-status@1/baseline-status.min.js" 
  type="module"
></script>
```

2. **Use the component**:
   You need the `featureId`, which you can find on [webstatus.dev](https://webstatus.dev).

```html
<baseline-status featureId="popover"></baseline-status>
```

### In React

With **React 19**, support for Custom Elements is native, so you can use it just like a standard HTML element.

```jsx
// React 19+
import 'baseline-status'; // Make sure the package is installed

function FeatureCard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Popover API</h3>
      <baseline-status featureId="popover"></baseline-status>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Result

What does it look like in practice?
Let's look at the HTML Popover status:

<BaselineStatus id="popover" />
