## Workflow

## 1. [Define Your Question](/my-learning-curve/guides/data-analysis/01-definition)

Before you start the analysis, you should know what you're looking for. This could be a specific question or a general idea of what you want to know.

## 2. [Gather Your Data](/my-learning-curve/guides/data-analysis/02-data-gathering)

This could be collecting your own data or finding an existing dataset that fits your needs.

## 3. [Clean Your Data](/my-learning-curve/guides/data-analysis/03-data-cleaning)

This involves handling missing or inconsistent data and may involve removing outliers.

## 4. [Explore Your Data](/my-learning-curve/guides/data-analysis/04-explore-data)

This involves using statistical techniques to learn about the relationships between variables.

## 5. [Analyze Your Data](/my-learning-curve/guides/data-analysis/05-analyze-data)

Apply statistical or machine learning methods to answer your question.

## 6. [Interpret Your Results](/my-learning-curve/guides/data-analysis/06-interpretation)

Make sure you understand what your analysis is telling you. This could involve statistical tests for significance, or it could be as simple as comparing the means of two groups.

## Example

```ts
// Load your data
const data = readFileSync('path_to_your_data.json', 'utf8')
const dataset = JSON.parse(data)
const column = 'name_of_the_column_to_analyse'

const cleanedData = dataset.filter(item => item[column] !== null)

// Explore your data
const mean =
  cleanedData.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item[column], 0) / cleanedData.length

// Analyze your data
const variance =
  cleanedData.reduce((sum, item) => sum + Math.pow(item[column] - mean, 2), 0) /
  cleanedData.length

// Interpret your results
console.log(`Mean: ${mean}, Variance: ${variance}`)
```
