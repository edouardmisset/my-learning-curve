## Unit Tests

Each component should be tested individually.

To achieve this, we use the library [Vitest](https://vitest.dev).
The choice of this library is based on its ease of integration with
our bundler (`Vite`) and its
API similarity to the previous one (`Jest`).

> A Vite-native testing framework. It's fast!

## End-to-End Tests (e2e)

End-to-end tests will be performed using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

End-to-end tests are located in the `cypress` directory at the root of the
project (as recommended by their documentation).
