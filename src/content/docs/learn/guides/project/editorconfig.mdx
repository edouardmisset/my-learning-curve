## Introduction

Different editors, different defaults: spaces vs tabs, 2 vs 4 spaces, LF vs CRLF. These seemingly small differences create noisy diffs and code review friction. EditorConfig solves this by letting your repository declare formatting fundamentals that editors respect automatically.

## The Core Concept

EditorConfig is a simple, editor-agnostic configuration file named `.editorconfig` that lives in your repository. It declares baseline style rules like indentation, line endings, and final newlines. Supported editors (built-in or via plugins) read those rules and apply them as you type.

Key ideas:

- Rooted configuration: set `root = true` in the top-level file to stop searching parent directories.
- Scoped by glob: define rules per file type/path using section headers like `[*.{js,ts}]`.
- Minimal and portable: focuses on universal formatting primitives; leave language-specific rules to tools like ESLint, Stylelint, Prettier, or Biome.

### A Practical Example

```properties
# .editorconfig (repository root)
root = true

[*]
charset = utf-8
end_of_line = lf
insert_final_newline = true
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2

# Markdown: do not strip trailing spaces (they can mean line breaks)
[*.md]
trim_trailing_whitespace = false

# Makefiles require hard tabs
[Makefile]
indent_style = tab

# Shell scripts
[*.{sh,bash,zsh}]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2

# YAML
[*.{yml,yaml}]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2

# JSON / JSONC
[*.{json,jsonc}]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2
```

This baseline reduces churn across platforms and editors.

## The Practice

### Where to put it

- Place `.editorconfig` at the repository root with `root = true`.
- Add nested files only when absolutely necessary (e.g., sub-projects with different conventions).

### How editors pick it up

- Most popular editors support EditorConfig either built-in or via an extension.
- VS Code: install “EditorConfig for VS Code”.

### Typical property set

- `indent_style`: `space` or `tab`.
- `indent_size`: number of spaces per indent (or `tab`).
- `end_of_line`: `lf`, `cr`, or `crlf`.
- `charset`: usually `utf-8`.
- `insert_final_newline`: ensure a newline at end of file.
- `trim_trailing_whitespace`: remove trailing spaces on save.

<Aside type="caution">
  Line endings are a cross-tool concern. Coordinate `end_of_line` with `.gitattributes` and Git settings like `core.autocrlf` to avoid flip-flopping diffs on Windows vs macOS/Linux.

### Quick checks and automation

- CI can use tools like `editorconfig-checker` to validate adherence.
- Some formatters (Prettier, Biome) can respect `.editorconfig` settings; see their docs to enable integration.

## EditorConfig vs ESLint vs Prettier vs Biome

- Purpose
  - EditorConfig: universal whitespace/line-ending normalization across editors.
  - ESLint: code quality and style rules for JS/TS (can auto-fix some issues).
  - Prettier: opinionated code formatter for many languages.
  - Biome: fast all-in-one for JS/TS/JSON (formatter + linter + more).
- Scope
  - EditorConfig: indentation, charset, EOL, final newline, trailing whitespace.
  - ESLint: patterns, correctness, anti-patterns, stylistic rules.
  - Prettier: layout/formatting (line wrapping, spacing, quotes, etc.).
  - Biome: combines formatter + linter; overlaps with ESLint + Prettier for JS/TS.
- Where rules apply
  - EditorConfig: editor/IDE behavior while editing.
  - ESLint/Prettier/Biome: CLI/CI and editor integrations on save/commit.
- Output
  - EditorConfig: prevents inconsistent whitespace from being authored.
  - Prettier/Biome: rewrites file layout consistently.
  - ESLint/Biome: reports and optionally fixes code issues.
- Overlap
  - `indent_style` / `indent_size` overlap with Prettier/Biome `useTabs`/`tabWidth`.
  - Prefer a single source of truth; if conflicts exist, formatter's config usually wins.

### Can they be used together?

Yes—and that's common in modern setups:

- EditorConfig + Prettier: EditorConfig handles universal basics; Prettier formats code structure. Prettier can read `.editorconfig` for `tabWidth`/`useTabs`.
- EditorConfig + ESLint: EditorConfig normalizes whitespace; ESLint enforces code quality rules.
- EditorConfig + Biome: EditorConfig covers basics; Biome handles formatting and linting for JS/TS/JSON.
- ESLint + Prettier: Either integrate via plugins or let each run independently (with `eslint-config-prettier` to disable style rules in ESLint).
- Biome as alternative: For JS/TS-heavy repos, Biome can replace both ESLint and Prettier; keep EditorConfig for editor-level consistency and non-JS files.

## When to Use Which

- Use EditorConfig when
  - You want consistent indentation/EOL across editors and OSes.
  - Your repo spans multiple languages and editors.
  - You need a lightweight, editor-agnostic baseline with minimal config.
- Use EditorConfig + Prettier when
  - You want consistent formatting across many languages with minimal debate.
  - You already standardize on Prettier opinions and want editors to align.
- Use EditorConfig + ESLint when
  - You care about code quality/correctness and static analysis for JS/TS.
  - You want auto-fix for certain lint issues but keep formatting flexible.
- Use EditorConfig + Biome when
  - You want a single fast tool for JS/TS formatting + linting.
  - You prefer Biome's ecosystem and performance over ESLint/Prettier.
- Consider Biome instead of ESLint+Prettier when
  - Project is primarily JS/TS/JSON and you prefer unified tooling and speed.
- Consider Prettier without ESLint style rules when
  - You want to avoid style debates; let Prettier decide layout, ESLint focuses on correctness.

## Pros and Cons

- Pros
  - **Portable baseline:** Works across editors/IDEs and OSes.
  - **Low friction:** Tiny config, easy to adopt, avoids noisy diffs.
  - **Polyglot friendly:** Applies to many file types via globs.
- Cons
  - **Not a formatter:** No control over quotes, semicolons, wrapping, etc.
  - **Plugin variance:** Some properties vary by editor/plugin support.
  - **Overlap confusion:** Needs alignment with formatter/linter configs to avoid conflicts.

## Deep Dive / Advanced Usage

### How precedence works

- Editors locate the closest `.editorconfig` to the file and walk up the directory tree.
- The first file with `root = true` stops the search upward.
- Later matches override earlier ones; more specific globs override broader ones.

### Glob patterns and specificity

- Use sections like `[*.md]`, `[**/*.test.ts]`, `[src/**/*.{js,ts}]`.
- Place specific sections after general ones to ensure intended overrides in all editors.

### Line endings and Git

- `.editorconfig` can request `end_of_line = lf`, but Git controls checkout/storage.
- Normalize with `.gitattributes`:

```txt
* text=auto eol=lf
```

- Combine with EditorConfig for a consistent authoring experience across platforms.

### Monorepos and nested configs

- Put a single root at the repository top.
- Add nested `.editorconfig` only where teams or technical constraints truly differ.
- Document intentional deviations to avoid surprise.

## Best Practices

- **Declare a root:** Put `root = true` in the top file.
- **Keep it minimal:** Only include widely supported properties.
- **Respect file conventions:** Tabs for `Makefile`, preserve meaningful Markdown trailing spaces.
- **Unify with Git:** Normalize line endings in `.gitattributes` alongside EditorConfig.
- **Align tools:** Mirror `indent_size`/`indent_style` with Prettier/Biome where applicable.
- **Document choices:** Explain non-obvious deviations in README or comments.

## Troubleshooting

- If settings don't apply, verify your editor's EditorConfig support and that the file path matches your glob.
- Check for multiple `.editorconfig` files; ensure the intended one is the nearest and `root = true` at repo root.
- Resolve conflicts with formatter/IDE settings by picking a single source of truth for indent size/style.

## Conclusion

EditorConfig is the low-friction way to eliminate whitespace and line-ending noise across your team. Add a small, well-scoped `.editorconfig`, align it with your formatter and Git settings, and enjoy cleaner diffs and happier code reviews.
