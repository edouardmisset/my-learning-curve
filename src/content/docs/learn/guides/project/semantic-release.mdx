import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'
import Source from './.releaserc.json?raw'
import PackageManagers from '../../../../../components/PackageManagers.astro'
import Disclaimer from '../../../../../components/Disclaimer.astro'

## Installation

See the [official
documentation](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/installation#installation).

<PackageManagers pkg="semantic-release @semantic-release/changelog @semantic-release/git @semantic-release/github @semantic-release/release-notes-generator @semantic-release/commit-analyzer" dev />

## Settings

These are basic `.releaserc.json` settings.

<Code code={Source} lang="json" title=".releaserc.json" wrap />

## Usage

Semantic Release automates the whole package release workflow including:
determining the next version number, generating the release notes, and
publishing the package. 

Add this script to your `package.json`:

```json
// File: package.json

"release": "semantic-release"
```

This is typically run in CI/CD environments. For GitHub Actions, add:

```yaml
- name: Release
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  run: pnpm run release
```
